Overview
This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a Password-Protected Circuit Breaker System. The system is designed to enhance safety during electric line repairs by restricting access to authorized personnel only. Unlike traditional circuit breakers, this system requires a password for operation, minimizing the risk of fatal electrical accidents caused by unauthorized individuals.

Features
Password Protection: The circuit breaker can only be operated by authorized personnel with the correct password.

Password Management: The system allows authorized users to change the password, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.

Automatic Reset: In the event of a fault condition, the circuit breaker automatically interrupts current flow. It can be manually or automatically reset to resume normal operation.

Enhanced Safety during Repairs: The system addresses the increasing electrical accidents during electric line repairs by incorporating secure password authentication.
