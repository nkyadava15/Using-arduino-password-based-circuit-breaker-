**Overview**

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a Password-Protected Circuit Breaker System. The system is designed to enhance safety during electric line repairs by restricting access to authorized personnel only. Unlike traditional circuit breakers, this system requires a password for operation, minimizing the risk of fatal electrical accidents caused by unauthorized individuals.

**Features**
1) Password Protection: The circuit breaker can only be operated by authorized personnel with the correct password.
2) Password Management: The system allows authorized users to change the password, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.
3) Automatic Reset: In the event of a fault condition, the circuit breaker automatically interrupts current flow. It can be manually or automatically reset to resume normal operation.
4) Enhanced Safety during Repairs: The system addresses the increasing electrical accidents during electric line repairs by incorporating secure password authentication.

**Usage**

1) Power on the circuit breaker system.
2) Enter the current password using the provided input method.
3) If authorized, you can operate the circuit breaker. In case of a fault, the system will automatically interrupt the current flow.
4) To change the password, follow the provided instructions in the documentation.

**Conclusion**
In conclusion, the Password-Protected Circuit Breaker System serves as a crucial advancement in electrical safety during maintenance and repair operations. The traditional circuit breaker is augmented with a secure authentication mechanism, requiring authorized personnel to input a password for operation. This innovation addresses the rising concerns of fatal electrical accidents, particularly during electric line repairs, by ensuring that only trained and authorized individuals have control over the circuit breaker.

The system not only enhances safety but also minimizes the risk of accidental interruptions to the electrical supply, thanks to the automatic reset feature in response to fault conditions. Additionally, the provision for password management allows for regular updates, strengthening the security measures.

This GitHub project provides a comprehensive solution for implementing the Password-Protected Circuit Breaker System, including source code, documentation, and a guide for users to set up the system. Contributions from the community are encouraged to further improve and expand the functionalities of this safety-enhancing technology.

By promoting secure and controlled access to circuit breakers, this project aims to reduce accidents, protect maintenance personnel, and contribute to the overall reliability and safety of electrical systems. We appreciate the collaboration and dedication of contributors to making this technology an integral part of electrical infrastructure management.
